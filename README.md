# CO2 Emissions Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores global CO2 emissions data to identify trends, rank top-emitting countries, and visualize key insights using a combination of Python (Jupyter Notebook), Power BI, and Tableau.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze CO2 emissions trends over time.
- Rank countries by emissions for specific years.
- Create interactive dashboards for exploration.
- Use geospatial maps to highlight regional differences.

---

## Technologies Used
1. **Python (Jupyter Notebook):**
   - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `geopandas`, `squarify`.
   - Used for data preprocessing and exporting cleaned `.csv` files.
2. **Power BI:**
   - Dashboards for time-series trends and country comparisons.
3. **Tableau:**
   - Advanced interactive visualizations, including geospatial maps.

---

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- Downloaded and cleaned CO2 emissions data using Python.
- Exported cleaned data for use in Power BI and Tableau.

### Phase 2: Visualization
1. **Power BI**:
   - Time-series trends of CO2 emissions.
   - Bar charts for top emitters by year.
   - Interactive dashboards for exploring data.
2. **Tableau**:
   - Geospatial maps for regional emissions analysis.
   - Interactive storytelling charts.

---

## Key Features
- Python: Automated data fetching, cleaning, and transformation.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards for business insights.
- Tableau: Geospatial and dynamic visualizations for deeper insights.

## Files
1. **projectwork.ipynb**:
   - Contains the Python code for data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. **co2.pdf**:
   - A detailed report summarizing key insights.
3. **Tableau.png**:
   - Screenshot of Tableau visualizations for CO2 emissions.

---

## Future Scope
- Combine data from multiple sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Use machine learning to predict future CO2 emissions trends.

---

## How to Use
1. Open `projectwork.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing.
2. Load cleaned `.csv` files into Power BI or Tableau for visualization.
3. Review the report (`co2.pdf`) for key takeaways.
